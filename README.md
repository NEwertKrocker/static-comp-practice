## Wins
  - This was an excellent way to learn some new CSS tricks -- to get more comfortable using `display: grid`, as well as using pseudo-elements to put a semi-opaque shader over background images and some other little bits of polish.

## Challenges + Improvements
  - Unfortunately, the weekend in question was pretty busy, and I wasn't able to implement some features that I had hoped to -- such as hover states for the menu icons and better responsiveness on mobile platforms.
